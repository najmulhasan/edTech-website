                        Bootstrap is much larger than Tailwind and requires multiple files to access its full
                        functionality. Because of this, using Bootstrap means a significantly larger file size than
                        Tailwind. Bootstrap also offers mobile-first, responsive components pre-styled to create
                        flawless website pages quickly.
                        Tailwind, however, is much younger and smaller than Bootstrap, which results in faster loading
                        times, but also has drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that because Tailwind is so new, it isn’t
                        quite as robust as Bootstrap. Tailwind is built to create functional, neat, and flexible UI
                        elements, and Bootstrap focuses on developing components for sitewide use.

                        Bootstrap is much larger than Tailwind and requires multiple files to access its full
                        functionality. Because of this, using Bootstrap means a significantly larger file size than
                        Tailwind. Bootstrap also offers mobile-first, responsive components pre-styled to create
                        flawless website pages quickly.
                        Tailwind, however, is much younger and smaller than Bootstrap, which results in faster loading
                        times, but also has drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that because Tailwind is so new, it isn’t
                        quite as robust as Bootstrap. Tailwind is built to create functional, neat, and flexible UI
                        elements, and Bootstrap focuses on developing components for sitewide use.
